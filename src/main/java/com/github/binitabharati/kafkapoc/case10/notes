Test done on Kafka cluster of 3 brokers; topic with 1 partition , and replication factor of 1 (topic5).
Use case: Demo that poll API always begins from the last committed offset. 

In this sample , auto-commit has been turned off.

Consumer-1 had got 1 msg in the first invocation of poll (msg val : CHK-0, offset = 0).After that, we did a explicit commitSync().
Consumer thread was restarted again (by running the java process again). This time Consumer-1 started receiving (msg val : CHK-1, offset = 1)

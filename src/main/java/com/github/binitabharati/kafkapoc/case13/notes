Test done on Kafka cluster of 3 brokers; topic with 1 partitions , and replication factor of 1.
Use case: Demo of ConsumerRebalanceListener. ie , in earlier cases, we saw that if Consumer does not
invoke poll often, the GroupCoordinator will deem it dead, and start a re-balance operation.We also saw that
comitSync is blocking, and is a sure shot way to commit, unlike commitAsync call.But, under conditions when
auto-commit is disabled, we should not be invoking commitSync too frequently. So, what is the ideal way to
invoke commitSync. commitSync should be invoked when a re-balance is about to happen.So, if we implement
ConsumerRebalanceListener, we will know exactly when re-balance is about to happen.And we can commitSync there.

Issue: Tried simulating rebalance by not invoking poll API. But, then ConsumerRebalanceListener APIs also get called
in same thread as poll API. So, if poll API thread is somehow stalled (by doing Thread.sleep etc), even the ConsumerRebalanceListener
APIs is not getting triggered.Finally, tried to manually assign partition using old Consumer.assign API.But, ConsumerRebalanceListener APIs
never got triggered. And, finally, both the Consumers (ie the one that implemented ConsumerRebalanceListener), and the one that invokes
Consumer.assign, both started getting the same messages.Initially, the autoconsumer got about 24 messages, and from 25th messages both
auto and manual consumers started receiving identical messages (even though num of partitions = 1).

Also, https://kafka.apache.org/0110/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.html assign API doc says that
one should not mix up ConsumerRebalanceListener and assign API.

Test done on Kafka cluster of 3 brokers; topic with 3 partitions , and replication factor of 2.
Use case to demo that async producer should be called by invoking get on the Future. This is because, just plain invocation of
kafkaProd.send(pr) will not throw any Exception, even when the send was not successful. Producer client will assume that all msges
got produced successfully, whereas consumer will not receive all the messages.

Test done on Kafka cluster of 3 brokers; topic with 2 partitions , and replication factor of 1.
Demo that using the same ProducerRecord key will force the message to go in the same partition as other messages with
the same ProducerRecord key.Message ordering will be maintained within each partition, so consumer will be able to fetch
the messages in the same order as the Producer produced it. 
No  of consumers started : 2, each consumer got assigned 1 partition.
I started 2 consumers sequentially, so once I started consumer1, this prints in its logs:
==============
consumer1:
2017-10-25 10:59:44 INFO  ConsumerCoordinator:262 - Setting newly assigned partitions [topic2-1, topic2-0] for group group1
==============
Then I started consumer2, this prints in log of both consumers:
==============
consumer1:
2017-10-25 11:06:19 INFO  ConsumerCoordinator:262 - Setting newly assigned partitions [topic2-0] for group group1
consumer2:
2017-10-25 11:06:19 INFO  ConsumerCoordinator:262 - Setting newly assigned partitions [topic2-1] for group group1
==============

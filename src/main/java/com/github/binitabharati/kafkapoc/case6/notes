Test done on Kafka cluster of 3 brokers; topic with 3 partitions , and replication factor of 2.
Use case to demo that async producer should be called by invoking get on the Future. This is because, just plain invocation of
kafkaProd.send(pr) will not throw any Exception, even when the send was not successful. Producer client will assume that all msges
got produced successfully, whereas consumer will not receive all the messages.So, u should also invoke a get() on kafkaProd.send(pr),
so that you can know the actual status of the produced msg. If u are worried abt get being a blocking call, just use ,multiple Producer
threads. But, remeber that using multiple producer threads may screw with message ordering (in case you r worried abt message ordering)
